# Machine Learning Practice

Hello,

I'm taking a Udemy course to learn Machine learning and, hopefully, expand my limited knowledge of Python.

I know that there will be some side projects and homework throughout this course, so those will most likely be done in their own repository.
Do not worry! I'll be putting the links to those repositories _right here_, in this readme!

#### Alex...

#### I'm sure they're doing _*juuusst*_ _fine._

_Okay!_

This means that I'll be updating this readme as often as necessary.

#### Thank you for taking an interest in my code!

### Best,

## Alexander
